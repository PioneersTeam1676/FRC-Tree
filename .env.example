# Permanent Admin Configuration
#
# PERM_ADMIN_EMAIL and PERM_ADMIN_PASSWORD define the permanent system admin.
# If these are present on first startup, that exact account is created.
# If they are added later, the existing system admin's email/password will be rotated to match.
# If PERM_ADMIN_PASSWORD is omitted on first run, a random password is generated and printed once.
